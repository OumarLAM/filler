# 🤖 Filler: The Ultimate Robot Battle on the Anfield 🏟️

## Overview

Welcome to **Filler**, the algorithmic game where two robots battle it out on a grid, filling it with randomly shaped pieces! The goal? Occupy the largest area of the Anfield and outmaneuver your opponent. It's strategy, speed, and a bit of luck all rolled into one exciting game.

## 🎯 Objectives

The main objectives of this project are to:
1. Develop an AI that can strategically place pieces on the Anfield.
2. Compete against another AI in a turn-based manner.
3. Achieve the maximum score by occupying the largest surface area.
4. Handle various game scenarios, including random piece shapes and sizes.

## 🏟️ The Anfield

The Anfield is a two-dimensional grid where the robots compete. It has an arbitrary number of rows and columns and starts with a predefined setup. Here’s an example of an initial Anfield (30x14):

```plaintext
..............................
..............................
..$...........................
..............................
..............................
..............................
..............................
..............................
..............................
..............................
..............................
...........................@..
..............................
..............................
```

## 🧩 The Pieces

The game pieces are randomly generated by the game engine. Their size and shape are unknown until provided during the game. Here are some examples:

Piece 2 2:
.#
#.

Piece 5 4:
.##..
.##..
..#..
...#.

Piece 6 3:
.##...
###...
#..#..

## 🤖 The Robots

Two robots compete on the Anfield, placing pieces in turns. Key points to remember:

- Each robot must place a piece with one cell overlapping its previous territory.
- The shape of the robot's territory must fit within the Anfield without overlapping the opponent’s pieces.
- The game ends when neither player can place a piece or an error occurs.
Your goal is to defeat all our robots, except the terminator!

## ⚙️ The Game Engine

The game engine runs your program, provides the Anfield state, and the piece to be placed. Each turn, it updates the Anfield and gives a new piece. The engine sends your player number in this format: $$$ exec p<number> : [<player path>]. You must then respond with coordinates in the format X Y\n.

### Example Gameplay

Initial Anfield sent to player 1:

```
$$$ exec p1 : [robots/bender]
Anfield 20 15:
    01234567890123456789
000 ....................
001 ....................
002 .........@..........
003 ....................
004 ....................
005 ....................
006 ....................
007 ....................
008 ....................
009 ....................
010 ....................
011 ....................
012 .........$..........
013 ....................
014 ....................
Piece 4 1:
.OO.
```

Player 1's response:

7 2\n

## 🛠️ Setting Up the Game

### Using Docker

To run the Filler project, Docker is required. Follow these steps to set up:

1. Build the Docker Image:

```bash
docker build -t filler .
```

2. Run the Docker Container:

```bash
docker run -v "$(pwd)/solution":/filler/solution -it filler
```

3. Run the Game Inside the Container:

```bash
./game_engine -f maps/map01 -p1 robots/bender -p2 robots/terminator
```

### Game Engine Flags

-f, -file string: Path to map.
-p1, -player1 string: Path to AI one.
-p2, -player2 string: Path to AI two.
-q, -quiet: Quiet mode.
-r, -refresh: Throttling mode.
-s, -seed int: Use a random seed number.
-t, -time int: Set timeout in seconds (default 10).

## 🎮 Usage

To run the game, you can use the provided Docker setup and game engine flags. Ensure your solution handles all game scenarios efficiently.

## 🏆 Bonus Features

Create a graphic visualizer for the game.
Develop an AI that can defeat our terminator robot.
